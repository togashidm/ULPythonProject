# ULPythonProject
Project assignment for Data Mining at University of Limerick 

Project Specs:

* The names and IDs of the students in your project group, which parts of the project each student has worked on, and what percentage of the whole work on the project is their contribution.

* Exploratory data analysis of the dataset.

* Data preparation:

  + Fill in missing values.

  + Remove or transform outliers.

  + Create new features from the existing ones [Optional if necessary].

* Predictive modelling: apply three different ML algorithms to build a predictive model for either classification or numeric prediction which is as accurate as possible. 

* Short conclusion that presents your final predictive model and summarises your findings. Aim at building a predictive model that is as accurate as possible.

* Apply a clustering algorithm to your dataset and visualise the clustering. Discuss the usefulness of the clustering for better understanding of the underlying patterns in your dataset.
